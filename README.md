8.28.21 Steph: Made it so that the .cpp will pull in a file
               Fixed MtoS function: Now it reads in time as a string, seperates it into minutes and seconds, converts those to int values and calculates the total seconds
               Added readFile function: Reads in the file line by line and assigns values to temporary variables. 
                                        Left commented-out the line of code needed to get rid of the underscores, but wasn't sure where to implement it. 
                                                    This required the "replace" command which is in the "algorithm" library.
                                        There is also a line of code for testing the MtoS function in here. 
               Good luck! Don't forget to push back to GitHub!
